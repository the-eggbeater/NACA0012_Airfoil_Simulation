# NACA0012_Airfoil_Simulation
The repository contains the simulation case and result files for the CFD analysis of Laminar Airflow over NACA 0012 Airfoil at various angle of attacks to compare its Lift and Drag Coefficients 
The ANSYS Project has been saved in Karakoram Folder.


For 0 Angle of Attack Project:
Karakoram ->0AOA -> Mesh2 SIMPLE 1000

For 5 Angle of Attack Project:
Karakoram ->5AOA -> SIMPLE 1000

*You can access the case and data file of the simulation in the above mentioned path

The Summary of C_d and C_l values obtained using various simulations is listed in C_d C_l.txt
Even though various methods have been mentioned, only SIMPLE Method with 1000 iterations result have been shown in the report.
